Carousel

An interactive sllide show I created to represent a few different still images. A project that allowed me to understand the DOM a little better.

SETUP: 

code editor: VS Code

1. Copy all HTMl code. Except the image node because you will add your own to give it a touch you prefer.
<img src="your own image">

2. Copy all CSS code.

3. Copy all JS code
